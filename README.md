# bought_together
Bought together is an algorithm inspired by amazon's website 'frequently bought together' feature.

How does it work?
This algorithm only takes into consideration items that where bought as order including two items only.
It randomly buys items with certain probabilty depending on previous number of purchases.
The more sells of a link, the more likely it will appear on the next random purchase event.
